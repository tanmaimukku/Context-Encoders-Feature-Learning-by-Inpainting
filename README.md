The main goal of the project is to implement the context encoders for Image inpainting as presented in the paper [[PDF](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pathak/papers/cvpr16.pdf)].

Our visual world is very diverse, yet highly structured, and humans have an uncanny ability to make sense of this structure like filling up the missing parts. In the above mentioned, few state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms have been presented.If center part of the
image is missing, most of us can easily imagine its content from the surrounding pixels, without having ever seen that exact scene. Some of us can even draw it. This ability comes from the fact that natural images, despite their diversity, are highly structured (e.g. the regular pattern of windows on the facade). We humans are able to understand this structure and make visual predictions even when seeing only parts of the scene
In this paper it has been shown that it is possible to learn and predict this structure using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a class of models that have recently shown success across a variety of image understanding tasks.
